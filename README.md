#### #1 Hello World

#### #2 Hamming:

Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

e.g:
```
    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
```    
The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

#### #3 Gigasecond:

Calculate the moment when someone has lived for 10^9 seconds.
A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

#### #3 RNA-Transcription:

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

```
 `G` -> `C`
 `C` -> `G`
 `T` -> `A`
 `A` -> `U`
 ```
