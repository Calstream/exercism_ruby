#### #1 Hello World

#### #2 Hamming:

Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

e.g:
```
    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
```    
The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

#### #3 Gigasecond:

Calculate the moment when someone has lived for 10^9 seconds.
A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

#### #3 RNA-Transcription:

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

```
 `G` -> `C`
 `C` -> `G`
 `T` -> `A`
 `A` -> `U`
 ```
 
 #### #4 Raindrops:
 
Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

- If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

```
- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, **7**, 14, 28.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 1, 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 10, 15, 30.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".
